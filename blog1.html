        Heyo guys, this is my first blog. Super Excited for this.üòÅ So in this
        blog we are gonna make a website.‚ú®<br />
        This blog tutorial is beginner friendly and does not require any prior
        programming knowledge at all. <br /><br />

        So before we get started lemme show you what you will have made by the
        end of this blog.<br />üëáüëáüëá <br /><br />
        <img src="/images/blog1/result.png" alt="final result" width="700px" />
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        Prerequisite<br /><br />
        VS Code(a code editor) installed. <br /><br />

        Note: My aim in this blog is to help you build a website with as minimal
        theory and knowledge as possible, so that you can get started in web
        development. However, in my later blogs, I will increase the complexity
        to further improve your understanding. So let‚Äôs get started.üòÉ<br /><br />
        Firstly create a folder on your desktop. Enter inside it. Then right
        click. Click on show more options. Then click on Open with VS code.<br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/blog1/open-editor.png"
          alt="open-editor"
          width="700px"
        /><br /><br /><br />
        This is how VS Code will look like.üëá<br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/blog1/vscode.png"
          alt="vscode"
          width="700px"
        /><br /><br />
        On the left side all the files that are created are shown. And on the
        right side all the opened files are shown. <br /><br /><br /><br />Now
        let‚Äôs start by creating an html file with the name ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù. Now why
        the name index.html? Extension html tells that the file is an html
        document. And index is a special name because when somebody clicks on
        your website this is the first page that is opened and from this page we
        can navigate to other webpages of the website.<br /><br />
        Now after creating a file, let‚Äôs enter inside it. Type ‚Äú!‚Äù and press
        enter. This will generate a boiler plate which looks something like
        this.<br /><br /><br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/blog1/boilerplate.png"
          alt="boilerplate"
          width="700px"
        /><br /><br />
        If you couldn't generate one. Here's is the template copy it and paste
        it.<br /><br />
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br />
        &lt;head&gt;<br />
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br />
        &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;<br />
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,
        initial-scale=1.0"&gt;<br />
        &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;<br />
        &lt;/head&gt;<br />
        &lt;body&gt;<br />

        &lt;/body&gt;<br />
        &lt;/html&gt;<br />
        <br /><br />Now let‚Äôs take two minutes and understand the bolierplate.
        (diagram explaining boilerplate.)<br /><br />
        All these html, head, body, title are called tags and inside them is
        some content. First line tells the document type i.e. html here. Second
        line has an html tag which is the root element i.e. everything is inside
        it. Html has two children. Head and body tags. Inside the head tag is
        the metadata i.e. information about your website for example the title
        of your website and inside body is gonna be all the content we wanna
        display in our website.<br /><br />

        I will use the term tag and element from now on.<br /><br />

        Now in the title tag write Your name instead of Document. And in the
        body tag write the main content that you wanna show on your page. I
        leave this to your imagination.<br /><br /><br /><br />Mine looks like
        this right now.<br /><br /><img
          src="/images/blog1/text.png"
          alt="text"
          width="700px"
        /><br /><br />
        Trick => use shortcut key windows + . to enable emojis menu.<br /><br />

        Now to see your web page changing in real time I would suggest you to
        install live server extension in VS code. To install it, open extensions
        (Ctrl + Shift + X) Search live server, select the first one, click on
        install. <br /><br />Once installed, click on Ctrl + F4 to close the
        tab. Then go back to file explorer(Ctrl + Shift + E) In your index file,
        right click. In the menu you can see the option ‚ÄúOpen with live server‚Äù.
        Click on it.<br /><br />
        Wait a few seconds and voila!<br /><br /><img
          src="images/blog1/firstlook.png"
          alt="firstlook"
          width="700px"
        />
        <br /><br />
        Theory time!!<br /><br />

        So far we have used only HTML. Hyper Text Markup Language is similar to
        text file as we just put some text inside both of them. But the
        difference here is that all the tags inside HTML help the web
        browser(chrome, edge, etc.) classify our content into headings,
        paragraphs etc.. More on that in my later blogs. For now we can think of
        HTML as nothing more than a file where we put all the content.
        <br /><br /><br /><br />Let‚Äôs admit that the web page we just built is
        kinda boring. So let‚Äôs design it. üé®üñåÔ∏è
        <br />
        This is where CSS language comes into picture. Cascading Style Sheets
        (CSS) are responsible for all the color, font, website layouts that we
        see in different websites. Let‚Äôs go by the convention and name our css
        file style.css Again ‚Äústyle‚Äù is by convention. It could be anything you
        want and .css tells that it is a css file.
        <br />
        Inside the file, write something like this:<br /><br />
        <br /><img
          src="/images/blog1/body.png"
          alt="body tag"
          width="700px"
        /><br /><br />This way we are referring to the body tag. Now whatever we
        write inside it is gonna apply on the body tag. Now I want to change the
        background-color to cyan. So I will simply write: To do that simply
        write bgc inside body and VS Code editor has automatically suggested
        us<br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/blog1/bgcolor.png"
          alt="bgcolor"
          width="700px"
        /><br /><br />

        Now removing the default color, type the color you like. I am going with
        cyan here. Shortcuts like these(entering the first letter of the words
        like bgc for background color)makes our coding process super easy and
        fast.<br /><br />

        Let‚Äôs save it(Ctrl+S) and see our website on the browser. Oops nothing
        changed!!ü§î
        <br /><br />
        This is because our index.html file doesn‚Äôt know that style.css exists.
        We gotta link them together. To do that, come back to the index.html
        file. Inside the head tag after title tag, write link and in the menu
        choose link : css and enter.
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        <img
          src="images/blog1/link css.png"
          alt="link css"
          width="700px"
        /><br /><br />
        <img src="images/blog1/link.png" alt="link" width="700px" /><br /><br />
        Inside the href attribute the name of your css file should be written.
        In my case it is style.css Now that we have linked the files
        successfully let‚Äôs save it (Ctrl+S) see the page again.<br /><br />

        This looks like something. Pat your back if you have followed me so
        far.<br /><br />

        Next I want to align the text vertically and horizontally. There can be
        many ways to do that. We are going to add two properties here:<br /><br /><br /><br />

        text-align: center; <br /><br />padding: 20% 0;<br /><br /><br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/blog1/align.png"
          alt="align"
          width="700px"
        /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        Now your webpage looks something like this.<br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/blog1/styledpage.png"
          alt="styledpage"
          width="700px"
        />
        <br /><br /><br /><br />Let‚Äôs say you feel like increasing the
        font-size. So let‚Äôs see typing fs(shortcut for font size) and see if
        there is any property like this. Indeed there is called font-size.
        <br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/blog1/font.png"
          alt="font"
          width="700px"
        /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        Select it and enter ‚Äúlarger‚Äù as its value. Save it and your website is
        ready.<br /><br />
