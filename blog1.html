        Heyo guys, this is my first blog. Super Excited for this.üòÅ So in this
        blog we are gonna make a website from scratch.‚ú®This blog tutorial is
        beginner friendly and does not require any prior programming knowledge
        at all. <br />
        So before we get started lemme show you what you will have made by the
        end of this blog.<br />üëáüëáüëá <br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/result.png"
          alt="final result"
          class="large-images"
        />
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h6>Prerequisite</h6>
        VS Code(a code editor) installed. <br /><br />
        <h6>Note</h6>
        My aim in this blog is to help you build a website with as minimal
        theory and knowledge as possible, so that you can get started in web
        development. However, in my later blogs, I will increase the complexity
        to further improve your understanding.
        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/memes/get_started-meme.jpg"
          alt="get_started-meme"
          class="small-images"
        /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        Firstly create a folder on your desktop. Enter inside it. Then right
        click. Click on show more options. Then click on Open with VS code. This
        will open the folder in VSCode.<br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/open-editor.png"
          alt="open-editor"
          class="large-images"
        /><br /><br /><br />
        This is how VS Code will look like.üëá<br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/vscode.png"
          alt="vscode"
          class="large-images"
        /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        File names will be shown on the left side. And all the opened files will
        appear on the right side.
        <br /><br />Create an html file with the name ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù. Now why the
        name "index.html"? Extension .html tells that the file is an html
        document. And "index" is a special name because when somebody clicks on
        your website this is the first page that is opened by default and from
        this page, the user can navigate to other webpages of your website.<br /><br />
        Type ‚Äú!‚Äù in the file and press enter. This should generate a boiler
        plate which looks something like this.<br /><br /><br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/boilerplate.png"
          alt="boilerplate"
          class="large-images"
        /><br /><br /><br />
        If you didn't get any suggestion. Copy the template below in your index.html file<br /><br />

        <pre class="code-snippet">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
     &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;
     &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,
     initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;</pre>
        <br /><br />Let‚Äôs take a minute to understand this bolierplate.
        <br /><br />
        <img src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/DOM tree.png" alt="DOM tree" class="large-images">
        <br /><br />
        First line tells the document type i.e. html here.Second
        line has an html tag which is the root element i.e. everything is inside
        it. Html has two children, head and body tags. Inside the head tag is
        the metadata i.e. information about your website for example the title
        of your website, the encoding method, etc. and inside body is gonna be all the content(like heading, paragraph, footer, etc.) we wanna display in our website.<br /><br />
        I will use the term "tag" from now on.<br /><br /><br /><br />

        In the title tag, write &lt;your name&gt; instead of Document. And in the
        body tag, write the main content that you wanna show on your page. I
        leave this to your imagination.<br /><br />Mine looks like
        this right now.<br /><br /><img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/text.png"
          alt="text"
          class="large-images"
        /><br /><br />
        <span class="green">Tip: use shortcut key windows + . to enable emojis menu.</span><br /><br />

        To see your web page changing in real time I would suggest you to
        install "live server" extension in VS code. To install it, open extensions<br>
        (Ctrl + Shift + X) Search live server, select the first one, click on
        install. <br /><br />Once installed, close the
        tab (Ctrl + F4). Then go back to file explorer <br>(Ctrl + Shift + E). <br>
        Right click in the index file. In the menu you can see the option ‚ÄúOpen with live server‚Äù.
        Click on it.<br /><br />
        Wait a few seconds...<br><br />Voila!<br /><img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/firstlook.png"
          alt="firstlook"
          class="large-images"
          style="border: 1px solid rgb(211, 245, 206);"
        />
        <br /><br />
        <h6>Theory Time!!</h6>

        So far we have used only HTML. Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML is
        similar to text file as we just put some text inside both of them. But
        the difference here is that all the tags inside HTML help the web
        browser (chrome, edge, etc.) classify our content into headings,
        paragraphs etc..<br><br> More on that in my later blogs. For now we can think of
        HTML as nothing more than a file where we put all the content.
        <br /><br /><br /><br />Let‚Äôs admit that the web page we just built is
        kinda boring. So let‚Äôs design it. üé®üñåÔ∏è <br /><br />
        This is where CSS language comes into picture. Cascading Style Sheets
        (CSS) are responsible for all the color, font, website layouts that we
        see in different websites. Let‚Äôs go by the convention and name our CSS
        file style.css Again ‚Äústyle‚Äù is by convention. It could be anything you
        want and .css tells that it is a CSS file.
        <br /><br />
        Inside the file, write something like this:<br />
        <br /><img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/body.png"
          alt="body tag"
          class="small-images"
        /><br /><br />This way we are referring to the body tag. Now whatever we
        write inside it is gonna apply on the body tag. Let's change the
        background-color to cyan. Simply write bgc inside body and VS Code
        editor has automatically suggested us the full property. Remove the
        default color and type the color you like.<br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/bgcolor.png"
          alt="bgcolor"
          class="small-images"
        /><br /><br />

        I am going with
        <span style="color: cyan">cyan</span> color here. <br /><br /><b
          ><span class="green">Tip :</span></b
        >
        Shortcuts like these(entering the first letter of the words like bgc for
        background color) make our coding process super easy and fast.<br /><br />

        Let‚Äôs save it(Ctrl+S) and see our website on the browser. Oops nothing
        changed!!ü§î
        <br /><br />
        This is because our index.html file doesn‚Äôt know that style.css exists.
        We gotta link them together. To do that, come back to the index.html
        file. Inside the head tag after title tag, write link and in the menu
        choose link : css and enter.
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/link css.png"
          alt="link css"
          class="large-images"
        /><br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/link.png"
          alt="link"
          class="large-images"
        /><br /><br />
        Inside the href attribute, the name of your CSS file should be written.
        In my case, it is style.CSS Now that we have linked the files
        successfully, let‚Äôs save it (Ctrl+S) and see the page again.<br /><br />
        <br /><img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/webpage2.png"
          alt="webpage"
          class="large-images"
        /><br>
        This looks like something!<br /><br />

        Next I want to align the text vertically and horizontally. There can be
        many ways to do that. We are going to add two properties here:<br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/align.png"
          alt="align"
          class="small-images"
        /><br /><br />
        <span class="green">text-align: center;</span>(to align horizontally)<br /><span
          class="green"
          >padding: 20% 0;</span
        >(to align vertically by putting 20% space on top)<br /><br /><br /><br />

        The webpage looks something like this.<br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/styledpage.png"
          alt="styledpage"
          class="large-images"
        />
        <br /><br /><br /><br />Let‚Äôs say you feel like increasing the
        font-size. So let‚Äôs see typing fs(shortcut for font size) and see if
        there is any property like this. Indeed there is, called font-size.
        <br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/blog1/font.png"
          alt="font"
          class="large-images"
        /><br /><br />
        Select it and enter ‚Äúlarger‚Äù as its value. Save it and your website is
        ready.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://nishayo.github.io/nishasinghal.github.io/images/memes/congrats_meme.jpg"
          alt="congratulations"
          class="small-images"
        />
        <br /><br />
